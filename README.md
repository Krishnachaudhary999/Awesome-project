Hello MIra,

Backlog for  Project Learning
	Task/Experience	Status	Improvement Action	Priority
1	Team collaboration and task division	         Completed	Continue fostering clear communication and role clarity	High
2	Sprint planning (new technique for team)	     Completed	Increase practice for efficiency and accuracy	Medium
3	Continuous integration and bug detection       Completed	Implement earlier to catch issues at the outset	High
4	Addressing technical challenges	In Progress	   Continuous learning of new tools and techniques	High
5	Stakeholder feedback	In Progress	Establish more        frequent feedback loops	Medium
6	Project documentation	Improvement Needed	              Allocate more resources for detailed documentation	Medium

By organizing this reflection in a structured backlog, I am better able to track both successes and areas for future development. This approach will help refine my skill set and improve project outcomes going forward.
