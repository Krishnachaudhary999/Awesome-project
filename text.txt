Backlog:
The community would feature an outdoor gym and playground, encouraging active and healthy lifestyles. A small shop or supermarket would prioritize the use of locally sourced products. Greenhouses and smart recycling systems for organic waste would be installed, promoting sustainability.

Solar panels would provide energy for electricity and water systems, while electric bicycles would be available for transportation. The community’s decor would be crafted from recycled materials, emphasizing eco-conscious living.

A portable sauna would be a key feature, along with tents used for both a health center and a dining area. Shipping containers would be repurposed into small houses and daycare facilities.

An app would enhance community interaction, allowing users to easily book sauna slots, communicate with daycare and health services, and manage other activities. The community would be conveniently located near the workers’ manufacturing facility.

Additionally, a club room would offer recreational space for adults and children, including a small library and board games for shared enjoyment.
